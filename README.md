# CFS-Crafter Help Information  

**CFS-Crafter** is an open-source MATLAB application designed for precise control, manipulation, and analysis of CFS stimuli. The application does not require prior expertise in image processing and analysis, making it an accessible tool for improving stimulus control, enhancing comprehension of CFS findings, and generating more effective CFS animations.

## 1. Screen Information  

Users must manually enter the screen details for stimulus presentation. This information is essential for calculating key parameters. The user cannot proceed to the next step without completing all required fields.  

### 1.1. Screen Refresh Rate (Hz)  

The *screen refresh rate* should match the refresh rate of the display used for stimulus presentation. An incorrect value may cause errors in frame rate and other temporal properties.  

### 1.2. Viewing Distance (cm)  

The *viewing distance* is the distance between the participantâ€™s eyes and the screen during the experiment. Incorrect values may lead to errors in calculations related to the degree of visual angle.  

### 1.3. Screen Resolution (pixels) & Screen Dimensions (cm)  

**CFS-Crafter** automatically detects the *screen resolution* and *dimensions* of the current display and sets them as default values. If the stimuli will be used on a different screen, these values must be updated manually. Incorrect information may cause errors in spatial frequency and other spatial properties.
